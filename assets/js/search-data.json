Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
